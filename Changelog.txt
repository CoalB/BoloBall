Version 1.1.0
=================================
Game Changes:


Code Changes:
Updated event handler to use "event.key" as opposed to the obsolete "event.which".
Changed "printBoardObject()" to use single quotes ubiquitously throughout the construction of the HTML.
Removed irrelevant sleep function.

Finished adding getters, and setters for almost everything for the gameBoard.js.
Added functinality for future features such as pointblock values from 1-99, and methods to modify player positions.
Working on removing all direct reference to variables, and changing them to getters, and setters.

Documentation of server.js is finished.
Documentation of serverBoard.js, and clientBoard is finished (they are virtually identical).
