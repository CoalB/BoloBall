General
----------------------------
X - Make it so that each block moved by the ball is a screen update. - Would have to rewrite and use animation frames, and a canvas.
Allow a toggle for the client to see the other player's balls ('L' key or something).
Add custom gameboard file import.
Make point blocks have custom value printed over them instead of generic pointBlock.png. (Only shows 10 points.)
For custom games have dynamic low, nomral, and high rates for blocks (Right now only chooses based on a flat value, and only row by row. Not total board area.).
Fix weird restart server, resume connection with phantoms.

Online
----------------------------

Sound
----------------------------
Make move, and kickball sounds depend on a T/F ret to prevent spamming and inconsistent noise for online play.
Prevent sound from playing in the results screen.

Fixed
----------------------------
Leaving before connecting to a game, not disconnecting for the server. (One if statement should fix it.)
Fix rooms not actually doing room things.
    Whispers are corrected, but the gameBoard object is changing for all. I believe it's an objects issue.
Scores don't reset after playing a game, and then waiting for an online opponent.
Game over detection is not working properly.
Add custom point block values (1-99), and change addPointBlock function to use pointBlockValue instead of a flat 10 points.
Add a waiting message so the first player knows what's up.
Move checks for Custom game arguments to the board.js.
